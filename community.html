      <h2>Our Values</h2>
      <section class="values">
        <article class="values-container">
      <h3>- Originality -</h3>
      <p>
          Every poster has been created with passion and great devotion by a
        unique artist. We hope to show how diverse and varied can one local
        community be, while still having a similar bond and sentiment over art
        and design.
        </p>
        <h3>- Support -</h3>
      <p>
        We aspire to support and be a platform for local artists from
        Copenhagen, Denmark by helping them showing their work and passions and
        inspire visitors to be more creative and have a deeper sense of
        belonging, in these isolating times.
      </p>
      <h3>- Community -</h3>
      <p>
        There are so many positive aspects to being part of a group or
        community. Providing unique opportunities for people to learn from each
        other and give support and encouragement are an invaluable part of
        joining forces with our peers. 
        <br />However, in recent times, this has
        been put into rupture. It can feel easy to feel alone and inspired,
        since we don't connect with our peers as much. </br>
        <br>Therefore, we aim to
        build a creative and dynamic community by sharing and organising
        creative events that can bring artists and interested people
        together.<br/>
